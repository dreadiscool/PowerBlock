PowerBlock, a Minecraft classic server!

Tired of bloatware like MCForge, MCLawl, and all of its variants?

Tired of a lack of versatility? We were too. As a result, we've created PowerBlock - a Minecraft classic server that lets you decide how you want to run your server! PowerBlock supports scripts ( plugins, for those of you from Bukkit! ) that can extend the functionality of the server!

It's extremely easy to pick up. Since scripts are written in JavaScript, you can even program for PowerBlock in Notepad! ( Though we recommend getting Sublime, it looks nice :D ).

As we continue to create the server, we will add more tutorials. Here is an example plugin that changes the login message for players
