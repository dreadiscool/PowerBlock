Thanks for trying out PowerBlock!

PowerBlock is now in a stable beta release mode. It works fine as a normal server. However, there are still lots of fine-tuning to the code to do, as well as fixing any bugs that may arrive. If you find a bug in my software, please, please, PLEASE tell me! I really need that information so I can make PowerBlock even better!
